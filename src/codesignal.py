"""PROBLEM#7 Even Digits Number"""
# A little boy is studying arithmetic. He has just learned how to add two integers,
# written one below another, column by column. But he always forgets about the important part - carrying.
#
# Given two integers, your task is to find the result which the little boy will get.
#
# Note: The boy had learned from this site, so feel free to check it
# out too if you are not familiar with column addition.
#
# Example
#
# For param1 = 456 and param2 = 1734, the output should be
# additionWithoutCarrying(param1, param2) = 1180.
#
#    456
#   1734
# + ____
#   1180
# The boy performs the following operations from right to left:
#
# 6 + 4 = 10 but he forgets about carrying the 1 and just writes down the 0 in the last column
# 5 + 3 = 8
# 4 + 7 = 11 but he forgets about the leading 1 and just writes down 1 under 4 and 7.
# There is no digit in the first number corresponding to the leading digit of the second one, so the boy imagine
# s that 0 is written before 456. Thus, he gets 0 + 1 = 1.

# Plan:
# Add every two numbers per corresponding two the same index together and if the sume is greater than
#  subtract 10
# If the length is not the same then append a 0 to begining of that parm until all two param have equal length
# Need a way of splitting all numbers into individual numbers --> list comprehension

# You are given a string strToSplit that consists of lowercase English letters only, and your task is to find the
# minimal number of good substrings you can split it into.

# Hint: Iterate over the string strToSplit and keep the ASCII codes of the smallest and the greatest characters in the current substring. Every time when
# the difference between them becomes greater than k, it means that the last considered symbol should be the first one in a new substring.

#
# For strToSplit = "aaabaaabb" and k = 0, the output should be goodSubstrings(strToSplit, k) = 4.
#
# strToSplit could be split into ["aaa", "b", "aaa", "bb"]. Each substring must consist of only one type of character, because
